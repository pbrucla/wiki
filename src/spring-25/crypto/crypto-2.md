# Crypto 2: Symmetric Cryptography

by Arnav Vora

We will cover symmetric cryptography this week. Instead of asymmetric cryptography, where different keys are used for encryption and decryption, symmetric cryptography uses the same keys for both. These are many benefits and drawbacks to this form of cryptography. We will discuss the two main forms of symmetric cryptography: block ciphers and stream ciphers.

## Challenges

The following challenges in increasing difficulty are deployed to [platform.acmcyber.com](https://platform.acmcyber.com) to practice the concepts covered in the slides.

These challenges are review from last week: (tags on the platform: crypto, cyber academy, week 3)

- `crypto/vigexor`
- `crypto/Practice Run`
- `crypto/bigram`

These are new challenges: (tags on the platform: week 4)

- `crypto/convenient-cbc`
- `crypto/extremely-convenient-beaker`
- `crypto/admin-login`
- `crypto/convenient-cbc`

## Resources

The following resources are great to practice/learn about the concepts covered in the slides.

- [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/): An open-source mathematics system that integrates with Python and is incredibly useful in many cryptography challenges.
- [pycryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/): A library that implements many modern-day cryptographic algorithms.
- [cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/): A website with many challenges related to cryptography
- [Modes of Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation) A good article about the different modes of operation of block ciphers.
