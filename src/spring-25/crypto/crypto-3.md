# Crypto 3: Advanced Symmetric Cryptography

by Arnav Vora

We further explore and review symmetric cryptography. We also delve into padding schemes for block ciphers and explore the padding oracle attack - an attack that uses padding to exfiltrate plaintexts! Finally, we also learn about modular arithmetic and its use in cryptography.

## Challenges

The following challenges in increasing difficulty are deployed to [platform.acmcyber.com](https://platform.acmcyber.com) to practice the concepts covered in the slides.

These challenges are review from last week that we will finish this week: (tags on the platform: crypto, cyber academy, week 4,5)

- `crypto/extremely-convenient-beaker`
- `crypto/convenient-cbc`
- `crypto/bigram`
- `crypto/admin-login`

## Resources

The following resources are great to practice/learn about the concepts covered in the slides.

- [pycryptodome](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodome/): A library that implements many modern-day cryptographic algorithms.
- [cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/): A website with many challenges related to cryptography
- [Modes of Operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation): A good article about the different modes of operation of block ciphers.
- [Padding oracle attacks](https://paddingoracle.github.io/): A website/tool to visualize and learn how padding oracle attacks work
