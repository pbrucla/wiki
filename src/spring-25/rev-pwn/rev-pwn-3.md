# Rev 3: GDB
by Alexander Zhang

This week's topic is GDB, a tool that allows us to control the execution of processes and inspect their state.
This is useful for debugging, reverse engineering, and exploit development.
We will also learn about GEF, a GDB extension with lots of useful features for CTFs.

## Challenges
A set of challenges with increasing difficulty are deployed to [platform.acmcyber.com](https://platform.acmcyber.com) to practice the concepts covered in the slides. You can filter for them on the platform by checking "rev" under "Categories", and "week 5" under "week". They are:
You can practice using GDB on the challenges from previous weeks:
- `rev/bomb`
- `rev/bomb2`
- `rev/bomb3`
- `rev/bobomb`
- `rev/flow`
- `rev/galfrekcehc`
- `rev/salsa69`
- `rev/jabeglnz`

We've also added some new challenges that are designed to be much easier to solve with GDB than with static analysis alone:
- `rev/dancing`
- `rev/boxing`

## Resources
The following resources are great tools for some of the reversing challenges:
- [GDB documentation](https://sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/): Information on using GDB
- [GDB reference card](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/download/onlinedocs/refcard.pdf): Cheat sheet with common GDB commands
- [GEF documentation](https://hugsy.github.io/gef/): Information on how to install and use GEF
