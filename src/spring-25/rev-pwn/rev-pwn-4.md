# Rev 4: Z3 and Pwntools
by Jason An

This week's topic is Z3, a constraint solver that lets us symbolically reason about values in a program.
This is useful for solving challenges where we need to reverse-engineer or generate specific inputs.
We will also learn about Pwntools, a Python library that helps automate exploits and interact with binaries more efficiently.
