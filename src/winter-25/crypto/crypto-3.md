# Crypto 2: RSA

by Gary Song

RSA has a huge signifigance for being the first pratical asymmetric cryptosystem, for which it was awarded a turning award. For that reason, it is an important foundation for any aspiring cryptographer to study about. We cover the RSA cryptosystem, what it is, what calculations are needed, and a short proof on why it works. Later, we will discuss common attacks on the RSA cryptosystem, and do some challenges from our cybersecurity competition this weekend (LACTF).

- Challenge 1 - `lactf: crypto/RSAaaS`
- Challenge 2 - `crypto/rubiks-cube`
- Challenge 3 - `crypto/prime-factory`
- Challenge 4 - `crypto/rubiks-cube-2`

## Resources

The following resources are great to practice/learn about the ciphers covered in the slides.
