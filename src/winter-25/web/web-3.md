# Web 3: LACTF Challenges

We hosted LA CTF this past weekend, a cybersecurity competition with over 1000 participanting teams! We wrote many beginner-level web exploitation challenges using skills we have learned in Cyber Academy, so we will try to solve them now!

## Challenges

The following challenges in increasing difficulty are deployed to [platform.lac.tf](https://platform.lac.tf) to practice the concepts covered in the slides.

- Challenge 1 - `web/lucky-flag`
- Challenge 2 - `web/I spy...`
- Challenge 3 - `web/mavs-fan`
- Challenge 4 - `web/chessbased`
- Challenge 5 - `web/cache it to win it!`
